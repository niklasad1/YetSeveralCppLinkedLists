## Tools
* Acceptance tests:         linked_list_tests.h
* Measure execution time:   chrono
* Memory leaks:             valgrind

## Notes
The exact measured execution time should be not taken to seriously because
it depends of all stuff such as:
  * Operating System
  * Cache
  * Compiler
  * How many processes are running
  * etc....

However, to achieve more accurate measurements it the measurements should be
performed many times and calculate the average

But for this purpose use the execution time to compare the implementations
very roughly i.e. if there differ in several magnitudes.

$ todo
