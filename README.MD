# YetSeveralCppLinkedLists
I have implemented several versions of double LinkedLists in C++ to demonstrate
and learn how modern features in C++ can be used to write better code.
But also demonstrate that SmartPointers are not magic but can be useful if they
are used correctly.

## BadLinkedListRawPointers
A very naive double LinkedList implementation using raw pointers that never manages 
memory incorrectly

## LinkedListRawPointers
A double LinkedLists implementation using raw pointers that manages memory correctly 
according to my acceptance tests.

## LinkedListSmartPointerBad
A very naive double LinkedList implementation using ```shared_ptr```

## LinkedListSmartPointer
TODO
