# YetSeveralCppLinkedLists
I have implemented several versions of double LinkedLists in C++ to demonstrate
and learn how modern features in C++ can be used to write better code.
But also demonstrate that SmartPointers are not magic but can be useful if they
are used correctly.

## BadLinkedListRawPointers
A very naive LinkedList implementation that never manages memory after deletion

## LinkedListRawPointers
A fairly ok LinkedLists implementation of raw pointers that handles memory and
do not leak memory

## LinkedListSmartPointerLeaky


## LinkedListSmartPointer
